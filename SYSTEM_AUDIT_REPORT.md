   - Check that `backend` directory is set as root

3. **Environment Variables in Railway:**
   - Confirm all variables from `.env` are added to Railway
   - Especially: `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_KEY`, `R2_*` variables

4. **Test After Deployment:**
   ```bash
   curl https://working-project-explainable-layers.up.railway.app/
   curl https://working-project-explainable-layers.up.railway.app/docs
   ```

### ‚ùå 7. Frontend (1/2 PASSED)

**Status:** NOT DEPLOYED

**Testing URL:** `https://novaxai.netlify.app`

- ‚ùå Frontend accessible: 404 Not Found
- ‚úÖ `.env.local` file: Properly configured with API URL

**Root Cause:** Frontend not deployed to Netlify or deployment failed

**Action Required:**

1. **Check Netlify Deployment:**
   - Go to Netlify dashboard
   - Verify site is connected to repository
   - Check build logs for errors

2. **Verify Build Settings:**
   - Base directory: `frontend`
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `frontend/.next`

3. **Environment Variables in Netlify:**
   - Add: `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://working-project-explainable-layers.up.railway.app`

4. **Trigger Manual Deploy:**
   - Go to Deploys tab
   - Click "Trigger deploy"
   - Monitor build logs

5. **Test After Deployment:**
   ```bash
   curl https://novaxai.netlify.app
   ```

   - Impact: No API endpoints available
   - Steps: Push code ‚Üí Configure env vars ‚Üí Verify deployment

2. **Deploy Frontend to Netlify**
   - Status: Not deployed
   - Impact: No user interface available
   - Steps: Configure build settings ‚Üí Add env vars ‚Üí Deploy

### üü° HIGH PRIORITY (Needed for Full Functionality)

3. **Upload Dataset to R2**
   - Status: Bucket empty
   - Impact: Cannot train model or make predictions
   - Steps: Run `download_dataset.py` ‚Üí Upload to R2

4. **Train and Upload Model**
   - Status: Model file missing
   - Impact: Cannot make credit predictions
   - Steps: Run `train_model.py` ‚Üí Upload to R2

### üü¢ LOW PRIORITY (Nice to Have)

5. **Update Kaggle SDK**
