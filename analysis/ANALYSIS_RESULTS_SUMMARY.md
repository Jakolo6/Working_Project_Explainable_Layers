### **Time Efficiency (seconds, lower is better)**

| Layer | Mean | Std | Median | Best? |
|-------|------|-----|--------|-------|
| **Layer 2 (Visual Dashboard)** | **72.6** | 88.8 | 38.0 | ✅ **FASTEST** |
| Layer 4 (Counterfactual) | 73.7 | 105.7 | 41.5 | |
| Layer 3 (Narrative) | 76.5 | 91.3 | 49.0 | |
| Layer 1 (SHAP Table) | 90.8 | 88.4 | 71.0 | ⚠️ **SLOWEST** |

**Statistical Significance:**
- **Friedman Test:** χ²(3) = 14.42, **p = 0.002** ⭐⭐ (significant difference exists)
- **Layer 1 vs Layer 2:** p = 0.009, r = 0.57 (large effect) ⭐⭐
- **Layer 1 vs Layer 3:** p = 0.028, r = 0.48 (medium effect) ⭐
- **Layer 1 vs Layer 4:** p = 0.020, r = 0.51 (large effect) ⭐

**Interpretation:** Layer 1 (SHAP Table) takes significantly longer than all other layers.

## 🔍 **Additional Insights**

### **Decision Outcome Impact**
- **Approved vs Rejected:** No major differences in ratings across decision types
- Participants rated layers similarly regardless of whether the AI approved or rejected the loan

### **Role Group Analysis**
- **Note:** All participants were classified as "non_clerk" (no bank employees in sample)
- Cannot compare banking professionals vs. non-professionals

### **Data Quality**
- ✅ **95.2% completion rate** (20/21 participants)
- ⚠️ **2.5% missing values** in post-questionnaire data (4 responses)
- ⚠️ **12 time outliers** detected (7.5% of observations)
- ⚠️ **2 incomplete sessions** (participants didn't finish all layers)

---

## 📈 **Thesis Implications**

### **Key Takeaway:**
**Layer 2 (Visual Dashboard) is the clear winner for XAI interface design:**
- ✅ Highest understanding ratings (significantly better than all others)
- ✅ Fastest completion time (significantly faster than Layer 1)
- ✅ Most preferred by participants (60% chose it as most helpful)
- ✅ Most trusted by participants (65%)
- ⚠️ Trade-off: Higher cognitive load than SHAP Table

### **Practical Recommendation:**
For credit risk AI systems, **visual dashboard interfaces** should be prioritized over:
- Technical SHAP tables (slower, less understood)
- Narrative explanations (moderate performance)
- Counterfactual explanations (lower understanding)

### **Research Contribution:**
This study provides empirical evidence that **visualization-based XAI interfaces** outperform traditional feature importance tables and text-based explanations in:
1. User understanding
2. Time efficiency
3. User preference
4. Trustworthiness perception
